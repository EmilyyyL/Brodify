Brodify

Can't BEAR studying alone? Have no fear, Brody the bear is here! In the midst of a long, lonely lockdown, Brodify is a website that incentivises collaborative studying and enables students to stay on track with their workload through gamification - and who doesn't love playing games? Students are able to create their own private room to study with friends or join public rooms and make new ones. Each user gets their very own to-do list where each task they complete scores them a point. These are displayed in their profile so they can flex to all their bros!
